A simple macOS App that switches light and dark themes based on light intensity around you and not by day or night time that can be set in Settings of your Mac. No more need to get into settings and switch themes when you can't see your screen in some conditions. Just install the app, set to run at login and let the auto themer do the rest. You won't even notice its backgroung work as it uses minimal disk storage as well as usage space.
